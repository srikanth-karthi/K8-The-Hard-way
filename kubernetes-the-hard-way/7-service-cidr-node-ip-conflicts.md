## **What you have**

**Private subnet CIDR** (nodes live here):

```
10.240.0.64/26  → usable IPs: 10.240.0.65 – 10.240.0.126
```

**Node IPs:**

* controlplane-0 → `10.240.0.70`
* controlplane-1 → `10.240.0.71`
* worker-0 → `10.240.0.80`
* worker-1 → `10.240.0.81`

**Service CIDR** (from `--service-cluster-ip-range`):

```
10.240.0.64/26
```

→ This is **exactly the same range** as your node IPs.

---

## **Why this is a problem**

* Service IPs (ClusterIP addresses) are supposed to be **virtual**, handled only inside Kubernetes via kube-proxy.
* Node IPs are **real**, bound to network interfaces on your EC2 instances.
* By using the same range for both, you’re allowing a **Service IP to conflict with a real machine IP**.

Example of the current conflict:

* Your kubelet config says `clusterDNS: 10.240.0.70`
* But `10.240.0.70` is already **controlplane-0’s real NIC address**.
* So, when a pod tries to query DNS, the packet goes straight to controlplane-0’s OS instead of to a virtual kube-proxy service — and DNS fails.

---

## **Correct design**

You need **three separate, non-overlapping ranges**:

1. **VPC CIDR** — covers all networking in the VPC. (You have `10.240.0.0/24`.)
2. **Node subnet CIDRs** — e.g.,

   * Public subnet: `10.240.0.0/26` (jumpbox, public-facing stuff)
   * Private subnet: `10.240.0.64/26` (all k8s nodes)
3. **Service CIDR** — **virtual-only range**, not used by EC2 at all.
   Common choices:

   * `10.32.0.0/24` (Kubernetes The Hard Way)
   * `10.96.0.0/12` (kubeadm default)

---

## **How to fix**

**Best option (clean)**

* Change API server flag on all control planes:

  ```
  --service-cluster-ip-range=10.32.0.0/24
  ```
* Pick a CoreDNS ClusterIP in that range, e.g. `10.32.0.10`.
* Update kubelet config on all nodes:

  ```yaml
  clusterDNS:
  - 10.32.0.10
  ```
* Restart kubelet and kube-apiserver.
* Install CoreDNS with `clusterIP: 10.32.0.10`.

**Quick hack (not recommended)**

* Keep Service CIDR as is.
* Pick an unused IP in `10.240.0.64/26` that’s not a node IP or `.65` (already used by the Kubernetes service), e.g. `10.240.0.90`.
* Update kubelet `clusterDNS` on all nodes to `10.240.0.90`.
* Install CoreDNS with `clusterIP: 10.240.0.90`.
